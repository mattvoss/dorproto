		<p>NASA’s top scientists—including a Texas A&amp;M University researcher—hope to find out how Mars’ climate has evolved over billions of years, and answers could come soon in the mission involving Curiosity, a Volkswagen-sized rover that is headed toward the Red Planet and will land in early August. It was launched Nov. 26, 2011, and is traveling at 13,000 miles per hour.</p>

		<p>Once there, it could answer many questions scientists have had for decades, including some involving the possibility of life on the planet, says Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric sciences professor at Texas A&amp;M who will serve as one of Curiosity’s camera operators.</p>
		
		<p>The mission involves Curiosity landing near the Martian equator and inside Gale Crater on Aug. 6, and for the next two years, it will investigate how climate change over billions of years has affected Mars and examine the nearby clay layers from an environmental aspect. It will also try to determine whether Mars has ever had conditions favorable for life, even in the smallest microbial forms.</p>

		<h2>Subheading</h2>
		<p>“<em>Curiosity will have the ability to drive scientific instruments, including a camera on a robotic arm, and also a new twist this time – high-definition video cameras,”</em> Lemmon explains.</p>

<img class="leadin-img" src="images/solarpipe.jpg" alt="">

		<blockquote><p>The cameras have the ability to take landscape images as well as some very closeup images, sort of similar to what you might see by looking through a magnifying glass. We hope to have some images of Mars we’ve never come close to getting in previous missions.</p></blockquote>
